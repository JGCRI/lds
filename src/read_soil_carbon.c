 read_soil_carbon.c
 
 read the soil carbon (kg/m^2) associated with sage pot veg cats
    soil carbon is soil only; it does not include root carbon
    data based on the previous level0 file
    sage pot veg cats are 1-15
    
 NOTE: use the pot veg soil carbon table from literature
 the values are averages across different climate zones
 
 NOTE: do not use the gridded data because it is for mixed land types
 2014 revision of IGBP-DIS soil carbon characteristecs database
    the text files have been converted to a binary image, with the two layers added together
    so this is soil carbon for 0-100cm
 
 arguments:
 char* fname:          file name to open, with path
 float* soil_carbon_sage:    the array to load the data into
 args_struct in_args: the input file arguments
 
 return value:
 integer error code: OK = 0, otherwise a non-zero error code
