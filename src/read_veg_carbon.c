 read_veg_carbon.c
 
 read the veg carbon text file (kg/m^2) associated with the sage potential vegetation categories
 data based on the previous level0 file
 sage pot veg cats are 1-15
 
 veg carbon includes root carbon, in addition to above ground carbon
 
 arguments:
 char* fname:          file name to open, with path
 float* veg_carbon_sage:    the array to load the table data into
 args_struct in_args: the input file arguments
 
 return value:
 integer error code: OK = 0, otherwise a non-zero error code
