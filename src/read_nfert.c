 read_nfert.c
 
 deprecated and removed from lds target
    the original processing ported here was wrong
 
 the input argument still exists, however, in the event that this gets fixed
 
 read the nitrogen application rate (kg/ha) into nfert_grid[NUM_CELLS]
 values range from 0 to ~221
 no nodata value
 
 from Potter et al 2010
    these data are based on SAGE harvested area
 
 arguments:
 char* fname:          file name to open, with path
 float* nfert_grid:    the array to load the data into
 args_struct in_args: the input file arguments
 
 return value:
 integer error code: OK = 0, otherwise a non-zero error code
