# Description
The `update_ctry_rast.R` script within this folder and the accompanying gdal commands (in the text file) were used to update fao_ctry_rast.bil with political ISO boundaries for non-land cells (water bodies) for moirai 3.1.

# Motivation
The original fao_ctry_rast.bil did not conatin boundaries of water bodies which made getting valid boundaries for non-land cells (like lakes) difficult. The boundaries of non-land cells are required, since moirai is now used to generate shape files for land cells, no-land cells and a combination of the two. (See the readme file in the diagnostics folder for a detailed description of the same.)

# Methodology
The script utilizes a generic shapefile `GCAM_32_w_Taiwan.shp`. ISO numbers from this shapefile are mapped to the fao codes using mapping files from within the LDS. This shapefile is then rasterized and combined with the original raster to fill in holes for water bodies. The gdal commands convert the raster file generated by the script to a binary raster which can be used within the LDS.

# Validation
We used the land test check functions (See the readme file in the diagnostics folder for a detailed discussion of the same) to verify any change in land outputs on account of the updated input file. No differences were found at the highest level. Smaller differences were found at the SAGE/HYDE level. However, updating the raster only increased land coverage and no ISO's or GLU's were lost.
